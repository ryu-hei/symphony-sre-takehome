# Technical exercise

In this exercise, we will be testing your container aptitude, docker, kubernetes and configuration management skills. 

- Deploy a Hello World website onto a kubernetes cluster! 
We would like you to show a brief understanding of the steps you took and any suggestions for better clarity of the exercise. 

Build a minikube cluster, you can create one by using minikube(https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) or you can use a kubernetes playground:
- Katacoda
- Play with Kubernetes

you will need to:
compose a docker image that will be deployed onto the kube cluster
then you will build a deployment.yml to push the docker into a kube pod
finally you will provide a service.yml to access the application from the web.


Some examples of code you can push -
Django Webserver

Once complete fork this repo - request a PR.
