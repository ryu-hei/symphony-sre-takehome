This is to show the steps of how to start up kubernetes by using minikube and add the container you have created into kubernetes.

Container creation
1. Docker compose installation.  Run following command to download docker-compose and install it.
Reference: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.2.3/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
2. Create docker-composer.yml to create a container.
Create a text file called docker-composer.yml and configure the detail of the container
My example is simple nginx web page.  Contents of the site can be stored in ./src locally to create the container
3. Run docker-compose to test the container. Run following command to test the container and see the container acts as web service.
docker-container up
Access http://localhost/ from the browser to confirm
ctrl+c to exit/terminate the container process

Once you confirm the container is working as planned, you are ready to implement it to kubernetes

Kubernetes installation
1. Run following commands to download minikube and install it.
Reference: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

2. Run following commands to download kubectl and install it.
Reference: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl

3. Run following commands to donwload kompose and install it.
Reference: https://kompose.io/installation/#github-release
curl -L https://github.com/kubernetes/kompose/releases/download/v1.26.1/kompose-linux-amd64 -o kompose
chmod +x kompose
sudo mv ./kompose /usr/local/bin/kompose

4. Run following command to start Kubernetes
minikube start

Implementation of container to Kubernetes
1. Run kompose to generate YAML files for Kubernetes
Reference: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/translate-compose-kubernetes/
kompose convert

2. Deploy geeenerated files into Kubernetes by running following command
kubectl apply -f file1,file2,file3
Files must be separated by comma

3. Access to deployed application by running following commmmand
minikube service container_name

You may run "minikube dashboard" to confirm the service is up and running in the kubernetes
Or curl to the loadbalancer or container ip address to confirm the service.
